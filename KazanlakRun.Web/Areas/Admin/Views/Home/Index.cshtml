                    Nestled in the heart of Bulgaria's Rose Valley, Kazanlak is a picturesque town known as the "Rose Capital" of Bulgaria.
                    Surrounded by beautiful landscapes and rich historical heritage, it offers the perfect setting for our running event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The town is famous worldwide for its Rose Festival, celebrating the harvesting of the Damascus Rose, used to produce the
                    acclaimed Bulgarian rose oil - a key ingredient in many perfumes. While visiting for the race, take time to explore the
                    UNESCO-protected Thracian Tomb, dating back to the 4th century BC, showcasing remarkable frescoes that stand as testament
                    to the region's ancient history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our race routes will take you through some of the most beautiful parts of the town and its surroundings, including parks,
                    historical sites, and the scenic countryside. With three distance options - 10km, 20km, and 40km - there's a challenge
                    suitable for runners of all levels.
                </p>
